    This document is aimed to guide in the process of creating a Linked Data (LD) version of a wordnet, and may be of interest for other kinds of resources. These guidelines contain advice on the vocabularies selection, RDF generation process, and publication of the results. As result, the converted language resource is more interoperable and easily accessible on the Web of Data by means of standard Semantic Web technologies.
    This document describes the models used and the recommended format
    (WN-JSON-LD) for representing wordnets on the Web that is based on
    <i>lemon</i>.
    We then describe the InterLingual Index, a common resource for providing
    interlingual links between wordnets, which is adminstered by the Global
    WordNet Association.

    <h2>What is WordNet?</h2>
	<p>
	WordNet is one of the most widely used lexical resources within natural language processing. From the time since the first version of WordNet was released, many resources have been produced that represent complementary information to WordNet  or extend it to other languages .
	</p>
	<p>
	WordNet  is a large lexical database of English nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs. Word forms are grouped into more than 117,000 sets of (roughly) synonymous word forms, so called synsets. These are interconnected by bidirectional arcs that stand for lexical (word-word) and semantic (synset-synset) relations, including hyper/hyponymy (tree-oak), meronymy (tree-branch), antonymy (long-short) and various entailment relations (buy-pay, show-see, untie- tie).
	</p>
	<p>
	WordNet’s synsets and its network structure yield a rough measure of semantic similarity among words and concepts in terms of synset membership as well as the number of arcs separating synsets. Due to its availability under open licenses, WordNet has become a popular tool for Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) and Natural Language Processing in general. WordNets have been built for around 100 different languages. Most are mapped onto the Princeton WordNet, enabling translation on the lexical level as well as cross-lingual WSD and applications. WordNet continues to evolve both in terms of coverage and representation of meaning. Recent enhancements include the addition of internet language and partially compositional multi word units. Finally, WordNet has been mapped to formal ontologies, including SUMO and KYOTO.
	</p>

    <h2>Selection of vocabularies</h2>

	<h3>lemon</h3>
	<p>
	lemon is a model that has been proposed  for the representation of lexicons relative to ontologies. As such, this model is well suited to the representation of semantic networks such as WordNet and defines many useful features for linking a WordNet to wider objects in the Semantic Web/Linked Open Data Cloud. lemon models lexicons by means of a core consisting of the following elements:
	<ul>
	  <li>A <i>lexical entry</i> which represents a single word or multi-word unit.</li>
	  <li>A <i>lexical sense</i>, representing a meaning of that word, which contains a reference to a concept in the ontology.</li>
	  <li><i>Forms</i>, which are inflected versions of the entry, and associated with a string representation.</li>
	</ul>
	
	
	
	In fact, in previous work  lemon has been used not only to represent WordNet but to integrate it with more syntactically sophisticated resources such as VerbNet. As such lemon shows potential to help in the integration of lexical data across many levels and languages. The lemon model is highly compatible with the ISO standard LMF  and forms the basis of the work of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/ontolex">W3C OntoLex Community Group</a>.
	</p>

	<h3>SKOS and Custom Vocabulary</h3>
	<p>
	In addition, to using the lemon vocabulary to model the semantics of WordNet, we use the SKOS vocabulary as this is better suited to WordNet’s structural model than a formal ontology language such as OWL. Furthermore, we introduce a new vocabulary at <a href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/ontology#">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/ontology#</a> to include properties found only in WordNet.

    <h2>RDF Generation</h2>

	<h3>Data modelling</h3>

	<div><img alt="An example of the modelling a single word and synset and links to other resources." src="Wn-rdf-example.png"><br>An example of the modelling a single word and synset and links to other resources</div>

	<p>
        It is not trivial to apply <i>lemon</i> to the case of a WordNet as 
        there is no clear ontology in WordNet. Clearly, WordNet’s words can 
        be regarded as lemon lexical entries and the word senses correspond 
        well to lemon’s lexical senses. WordNet has lemmas and a separate 
        list of variants of these, and as such we recommend creating a canonical form for 
        each lemma and a form object for each of these variants. Since there is 
        currently no indication in WordNet of what grammatical properties these 
        variants have, we do not recommend attaching additional properties to these 
        variants/forms. As lemon is a model for ontology-lexica, the main 
        question is what the reference of the lexical senses should be. We 
        recommend regarding WordNet’s synsets as ontological references, but 
        instead of assigning them a formal ontological type (e.g., class, 
        property or individual), we introduce a new type <tt>Synset</tt> 
        as a subclass of <tt>Concept</tt> in SKOS.
	</p><p>
        This allows the nature of synsets to be captured without ontologizing 
        the semantic network. Similarly, we introduce relations such as 
        hypernymy, meronymy etc. as new properties rather than attempt to 
        relate them to existing ontological properties such as OWL’s 
        <tt>subClassOf</tt>. In order to capture the new properties, 
        an ontology has been created at <a href="http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/ontology">http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/ontology</a>
	</p>

	<h3>URI design</h3>
	<p>
	Another key question concerns the identifiers to use for each element in the data. 
        In order to enable browsability, we recommend that each entry and each synset
        has its own page and thus it own URI. We do not recommend distributing
        WordNets as a single flat file as they are large and this impedes their
        access on the web. You should assign new identifiers using the existing identifiers in your wordnet.
        Furthermore, as wordnets have released several versions and are still under development, 
        we consider it important to include the version number in the URI. 
        As such, we recommend the following scheme for URIs, as exemplified below:
	
	<ul>
	  <li>Each lexical entry is represented by means of the URL-encoded lemma and then a dash followed by the part-of-speech as a single letter (i.e., ‘n(oun)’, ‘v(erb)’, ‘a(djective)’, ‘r (adverb)’, ‘adjective s(atellite)’ or ‘p(article)’).</li>
	  <li>Senses and forms in the model use the entry URI and add a fragment identifier. For forms for which there is no previous identifier in WordNet, we use CanonicalForm and Form-n where n is a number. For senses, the fragment is the index of the senses and the part of speech.</li>
	  <li>Synsets are similarly are identified by a number consisting of 8 or 9 digits corresponding to offset codes in the WordNet database The 9 figure codes include an extra initial digit for part-of-speech, followed by a dash and the part of speech as a single letter.</li>
	</ul>
		
	Examples of this scheme include:
<div>
<textarea id="example1">
http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/cat-n
http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/cat-n#CanonicalForm
http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/cat-n#2-n
http://wordnet-rdf.princeton.edu/wn31/300001740-a</textarea>
</div>

	</p>

        <h3>WordNet JSON</h3>
        <p>
        In combination with the <a href="http://globalwordnet.org">Global WordNet
            Association</a>, we have developed a set of guidelines for creating 
        wordnets as linked data. This can be done in either the <a 
            href="http://www.lexicalmarkupframework.org">LMF</a>-compliant
        WN-LMF format or using the JSON-LD enabled schema below. The JSON-LD 
        schema consists of the following elements

        <ul>
            <li><b>Lexicon</b> the root of a document should be a lexicon or a 
            lexical entry that consists of a number of Lexical Entries</li>
            <li><b>A Lexical Entry</b> is a single word or multiword expression
            as defined by <a href="http://lemon-model.net/">lemon</a></li>
            <li>Each lexical entry must have exactly one <b>Lemma</b> it may
            have any number of other forms. Each of these must have a 
            single <b>Written Representation</b></li>
            <li>It may have other properties such as part-of-speech, see
            documentation at <a href="http://globalword.github.io/schemas/JSON-LD.md">
                http://globalword.github.io/schemas/JSON-LD.md</a></li>
            <li>Any number of <b>senses</b> each of which should link to
            <b>synsets</b> and give a gloss plus any lexical relationships such
            as <b>hypernym</b>
        </ul>

        An example of an entry given in JSON-LD is as follows, please refer 
        to the <a href="http://globalword.github.io/schemas/JSON-LD.md">Global WordNet
            documentation</a> for more details.

    <h2>Linking to the Interlingual Index</h2>

    Once a wordnet has been created, its synsets should be linked into the 
    <b>Collaborative Interlingual Index</b> which is maintained at 
    <a href="http://globalwordnet.org/ili/">http://globalwordnet.org/ili/</a>.
    For up-to-date information about creating wordnets you should refer to the
    Global WordNet Association site.  
    You may link to the ILI by choosing the appropriate links from the RDF graph
    as linking using the usual mechanism and as many resources will be linked 
    to the ILI this guarantees the connectivity of your resource. You may also
    ask that your wordnet is indexed as part of the ILI, this request requires 
    that:

    <ol>
        <li>Your resource has an license that allows redistribution with only
        attribution. Non-commercial and Share-A-Like license are not accepted.</li>
        <li>The resource is in WordNet LMF or WordNet JSON</li>
        <li>Every synset in your wordnet has a definition <i>in English</i></li>
        <li>Every synset is either linked to the ILI as either a synonym, hypernym,
        antonym or meronym</li>
        <li>You do not create any duplicates of concepts already in the ILI (this
        is checked by automatic methods)</li>
        <li>Definitions are written according to the quality guidelines on the
        Global WordNet Assocation webpage</li>
    </ol>

    Details of how to submit your wordnet can be found at the Global WordNet 
    Association homepage.
